# how to play backed up DVDs
1. Double-click on the ISO file so that Mac OS mounts it as a drive.
2. Run the Mac OS DVD Player. The Mac OS DVD Player should automatically start playing the DVD.

# why back up your DVDs to ISOs
The entire contents of the DVD including the menu navigation will still be usable from the ISO file. Other methods of backing up DVDs usually require you to 'transcode' the DVD videos into other formats which typically reduces their size but gives up the DVD navigation menu and potentially some audio tracks and subtitles in different languages. This method preserves the DVD in its entirety.
