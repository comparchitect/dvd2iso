# how to back up DVDs using the script

# how to play backed up DVDs
1. Double-click on the ISO file so that Mac OS mounts it as a drive.
2. Run the Mac OS DVD Player. The Mac OS DVD Player should automatically start playing the DVD.

# why back up your DVDs to ISOs
The entire contents of the DVD including the menu navigation will still be usable from the ISO file. Other methods of backing up DVDs usually require you to 'transcode' the DVD videos into other formats which typically reduces their size but gives up the DVD navigation menu and potentially some audio tracks and subtitles in different languages. This method preserves the DVD in its entirety.

# why back up your DVDs in general
If you've ever tried to back up your old VHS tapes to digital format to find that your VCR doesn't work anymore and your only other options have become far more expensive than you expected, then you'll appreciate the need to get your DVDs into a newer format before it's too late. Basically, old storage media can become obsolete along with the devices that are required to read them and data can be lost as the storage medium itself ages.
